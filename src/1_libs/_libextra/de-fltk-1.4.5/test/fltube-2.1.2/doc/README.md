# FLTube

FLTube is an application for search & stream Youtube videos. Written for [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/) and powered by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

Although initially developed for [Spirit-OS](https://spirit-os.sourceforge.io/) distribution, but can be compiled for other modern distributions with a C++ compiler.

### Features
- A very lighweight app thanks to **C++** and **FLTK** toolkit *(support for FLTK 1.3.x or above)*.
- Powered by **yt-dlp**, a feature-rich command-line audio/video downloader developed in Python.
- With capabilities to search for videos on YouTube using search terms or a specific YouTube URL.
- Ability to remember the watched and liked videos, as well as features to explore those videos through a "Navigation History" and a "Liked" video list.
- Configurations available for change stream video resolution: 240p, 360p (default), 480p, 720p and 1080p.
- Localized in English and Spanish, with the potential for future translation into other languages. Localization is done using [GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/).
- Designed for low screen resolutions on small screens.
- For now, the app only was tested on GNU/Linux.

## Installing from a Package

32-bit and 64-bit .deb packages can be downloaded and installed, as well as an installation package for TinyCore-based distributions (.tcz).

- Download from the [official FLTube website](https://fltube.sourceforge.io/).

- Download from the [releases on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/facuA/fltube/-/releases).

## Compile and install from source.

Once downloaded the source code, you can compile it using [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). 
> NOTE: By default, the installation directories are under `/usr/local`, so to find the binaries correctly after installation, you must ensure that `/usr/local/bin` is on your `$PATH` environment variable.

### On FLinux, SpiritOS, or any TinyCore-based distro

Install app dependencies and compile using *make*.

```bash
$ tce-load -wi make.tcz fluid.tcz pkg-config.tcz gettext.tcz \ 
    curl-dev.tcz gcc.tcz glibc_base-dev.tcz tcc.tcz mplayer-cli.tcz 

# Download and install Python 3.11.
$ wget -q -O /tmp/python3.11.tcz  https://gitlab.com/-/project/74160365/uploads/f286ad3d76aabc21492b31853c76bd0c/python3.11.tcz
$ tce-load -i python3.11.tcz

$ sudo make install

$ fltube        ## To open app.
```

On some distribution more minimalist, like [FLinux](https://flinux-distro.sourceforge.io/), you must install some extra packages: 
```bash
$ tce-load -wi ffmpeg4.tcz libEGL.tcz bash.tcz squashfs-tools.tcz
``` 

### On a Debian-based distro

Install app dependencies and compile using *make*.
```bash
$ sudo apt install libfltk1.3-dev pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev g++ python3 gettext wget mplayer\
    ffmpeg libpng-dev zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev libxrender-dev libxcursor-dev libxfixes-dev libxext-dev \
    libxft-dev libfontconfig1-dev libxinerama-dev
    
$ sudo make install

$ fltube        ## To execute app.
```

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the app from your system, you can run `make uninstall`.

## Development mode

You can install the app in a sort of *"development mode"*, so instead of running `make install` you can do:

```bash
$ make PREFIX=./build install    ## Compile at relative path "./build"

$ ./build/usr/local/bin/fltube   ## Relative path to execute app.
```
Running *make* like this will let you delete the app more easily from your system (since everything is concentrated in a relative directory), besides let you make your own modifications and test them in a controlled development environment.

```bash
$ make clean    ## Finally, for clean ./build directory
```

### Contributions

If you want to make a contribution (report issues, fix bugs, improve the code, add new features, translate to your language), you can open an issue at https://gitlab.com/facuA/fltube/-/issues.

## *yt-dlp* installation

Is recommended to use the latest version of **yt-dlp**, so we encouraged to use the installation script provided by this app.

Once FLTube is installed, run this command on a terminal to install *yt-dlp*:
```bash
$ install_yt-dlp.sh
```
By default, **yt-dlp** will be installed at `$HOME/.local/bin`, but you can change the target installation directory using the `-p` parameter. Run `install_yt-dlp.sh -h` for more help.
