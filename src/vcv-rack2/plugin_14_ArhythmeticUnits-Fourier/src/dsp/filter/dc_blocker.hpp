/// @brief A DC blocking filter comprised of a digital differentiator and a
/// leaky integrator in cascade.
/// @details
///
/// ## Digital Differentiator
///
/// DC can be perfectly blocked using a _digital differentiator_ that results
/// in infinite attenuation of DC, but has a logarithmic roll-off into the
/// higher order frequency components that is undesirable. The digital
/// differentiator has a transfer function in the \f$z\f$-domain with a zero at
/// \f$z = 1\f$:
///
/// \f$H_{\text{differentiator}}(z) = 1 - z^{-1}\f$
///
/// In the time domain, this becomes simply:
///
/// \f$y[n] = x[n] - x[n - 1]\f$
///
/// ## Leaky Integrator
///
/// To counteract the effect on the higher frequency components, a pole can be
/// placed near the zero to flatten out the pass-band and sharpen the
/// transition band. A coefficient \f$p \in (0, 1)\f$ controls the proximity of
/// the pole to \f$z = 1\f$. As \f$p \to 1\f$, the transition width approaches
/// \f$0\f$. The transfer function of the one-pole filter can be written as:
///
/// \f$H_{\text{integrator}}(z) = \frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}}\f$
///
/// which has a time domain representation of:
///
/// \f$y[n] - p y[n - 1] = x[n]\f$
///
/// ## DC Blocker
///
/// A DC blocking filter can be formed as the cascade of the digital
/// differentiator with a leaky integrator where \f$p \in (0, 1)\f$ controls
/// the transition band width.
///
/// \f$H(z) = H_{\text{differentiator}}(z)H_{\text{integrator}}(z)\f$
///
/// In the time domain, this becomes:
///
/// \f$y[n] - p y[n - 1] = x[n] - x[n - 1]\f$
///
