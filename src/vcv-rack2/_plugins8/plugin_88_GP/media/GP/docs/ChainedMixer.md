<h1>Chained Mixer - Modular Stereo Mixer</h1>

**Chained Mixer** is a module in the GP plugin for VCV Rack 2

<h2>Available Modules</h2>

The Chain Mixer consists of three modules:

* Channel - an Input channel
* Master - the Master section 
* Aux - an optional Aux Send/Return section

Up to 16 Channel modules can be combined with one Master and one Aux section by putting them into adjacent slots in your rack.

<h2>Channel Module</h2>

Use this module to provide input signals to the mixer.

Up to 16 Channel modules can be part of one chain of mixer modules. Any additional modules,
counting from left to right, will be non-functional.

<h3>Sockets</h3>

This module has two sockets for a mono or stereo input signal. The input sockets
accept signals from polyphonic cables and sum together all polyphonic channels before
feeding them into the internal monophonic mixing.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

Each channel has a **MUTE** and a **SOLO** button. Please note that the two buttons
do not interact because this would mess with MIDI mapping of the buttons. So you can
have a channel in Mute and Solo simultaneously, in which case it will be muted.

The **FADER** controls the signal gain. The 0 dB position is marked, and the maximum gain
value is +12 dB.

The **PAN/BAL** knob controls the position of the signal in the stereo field. If a stereo
source is connected, it will work as a Balance control with 0 dB gain in the middle position
and decreasing level of one channel to either side. If a mono input is connected to one of
the input sockets, it will work as a panorama control with a gain of -3 dB in the middle
position to approximate equal loadness across the panning range.

**AUX1** and **AUX2** are two independent post-fader busses that are usually used to
hook up effect devices such as a reverb. Both AUX knobs provide a maximum gain of 0 dB.

Channel modules are numbered from left to right, if more than the supported 16 channels
are combined, the extra channels will not show a number and will be disabled.

<h2>Master Module</h2>

The Master module provides the main output of the mixer.

There has to be exactly one Master module in an adjacent group of Chained Mixer modules.
If two or more Master modules are detected, only the leftmost module of them will be active.
If no Master module is present, the mixer will nor work.

<h3>Sockets</h3>

The Master module provides two sockets for the stereo output signal. The output signal is
monophonic, any polyphonic signals coming into the Channel or Aux modules are summed into
a monophonic signal before mixing takes place.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

The **MUTE** button shuts off the output signal.

The **FADER** controls the audio level on the output sockets. The 0dB position is marked
and the gain can be adjusted up to +12 dB.

**AUX1** and **AUX2** are the overall gain controls for the AUX bus send outputs. Their maximum gain is 0 dB.

<h2>Aux Module</h2>

The Aux module provides the connections for the two AUX devices as well as some controls for
them. Only one Aux module can be active in an adjacent group of Chained Mixer modules. If two
or more Aux modules are detected, only the leftmost module of them will be active.

<h3>Sockets</h3>

For each of the AUX devices there is a stereo set of **SEND** output sockets and a
stereo set of **RETURN** input sockets. It is possible to use Send and/or Return in mono,
the mixer will handle summing and panning accordingly.

The **RETURN** input sockets will accept polyphonic cabels and create an internal monophonic sum
from them before they are mixed to the Master module's output. The **SEND** outputs provide a
monophonic signal.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

Like the Channel module, the Aux module has **SOLO** and **MUTE** buttons that affect
the inpot signals from the Return sockets.

A **FADER** for each Aux Return signal adjusts its gain before it gets mixed into
the output signal of the Master module. The 0 dB position is marked, and the maximum gain is +12 dB.
