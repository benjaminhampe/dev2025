These modules solve the differential ecuations of each system using [Euler's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method), aproximating each increment with a straight line, and scaling the increment by sample with the parameter **Rate**. This parameter has an effect similar to a "frecuency" or "pitch" parameter in periodic oscillators. The button **HF/LF** changes the range of the **Rate** knob and CV modulation input between high frecuency and low frecuency.

The other three parameters **P1**, **P2** and **P3**, are mapped to the values of the ecuations constans. These have unpredictable effects on the generated signal due to its chaotic nature.

Since the ecuations are 3-dimensional, each point has 3 independent components, each mapped to one of the three outputs **X**, **Y** and **Z**.

There is also a **Reset** input, which receives Trigger signals and returns the system to its initial conditions. Since the systems are deterministic, this also serves as a Sync input.

The Rossler's oscillator module follows the following differential ecuations modeling [Rossler's attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ssler_attractor):

In this case, as the ecuations constants and the module parameters have a 1-to-1 correspondence, the module parameters are named **A**, **B** and **C**, after the constant each of them modify.

The Lorentz84 oscillator module follows the following differential ecuations modeling the [Lorentz84 system](https://docs.dart.ucar.edu/en/latest/models/lorenz_84/readme.html):

## Signals

These oscillators are chaotic non-linear system, known as [strange attractors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor), which means the signals generated are deterministic but non-periodic. Depending on the values of its parameters, the system has periodic states, noise-like states, and a spectrum of in-between states.

The three signal outputs **X**, **Y** and **Z**, corresponding to the three components of the system, have similar behaviours but different spectral qualities, which can be useful when used as an audio signal.
