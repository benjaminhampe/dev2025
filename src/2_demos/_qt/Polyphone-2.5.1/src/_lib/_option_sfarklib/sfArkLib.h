Changes since V1.15
===================
All constants now prefixed with SFARKLIB_, and function names prefxied with sfkl_

sfkl_GetLicenseAgreement and sfkl_DisplayNotes functions now both take 2 parameters: the text of the text file
and the name of the text file. This makes it easier for the application to either display the text itself or pass
the filename onto some other program.  Mac/Linux users note: the text is probably in Windows format! 
Future sfArk versions will allow Notes and License files to be of other types than plain text (e.g. HTML, RTF) so
look at the file extenson in order to decide how to handle it.

// Some max sizes...

																	
// Future SfArkLib versions may include additional further error codes,
// so, any other negative value is "unknown error"
